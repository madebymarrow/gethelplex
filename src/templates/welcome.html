Casey's Law
</a></b></h5>
<div class="collapse" id="caseys_law">
  <p>
    The Matthew Casey Wethington Act for Substance Abuse Intervention is named for Matthew Casey Wethington, 
    who died in 2002 from a heroin overdose at the age of 23. Casey was an energetic young man who enjoyed 
    life until it was “taken” by drugs. Casey never intended to become addicted to drugs when he used the first time. 
    What he did not realize was that his using would progress from abusing to dependence and then to the disease of addiction. 
    Although his parents tried to get him help, there was no law that could force someone into treatment because he was an 
    adult. After Casey’s death his parents lobbied for a change. “Casey’s Law” is an involuntary treatment act for 
    those who suffer from the disease of addiction.
